## Your Task
You don't need to input anything.  
Complete the function **`printSquare()`** which takes an integer `n` as the input parameter and prints the pattern.

## Constraints

1 <= n <= 1000

---

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(nÂ²) â€” iterates over all nÃ—n positions  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) â€” uses no extra space
