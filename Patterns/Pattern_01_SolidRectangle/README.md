## Problem Statement
Geek is very fond of patterns. Once, his teacher gave him a square pattern to solve.  
He gave Geek an integer `n` and asked him to build a square pattern using `*` such that each `*` is space-separated in each line.

## Your Task
You don't need to input anything.  
Complete the function **`printSquare()`** which takes an integer `n` as the input parameter and prints the pattern.

## Constraints

1 <= n <= 1000

---

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(nÂ²) â€” iterates over all nÃ—n positions  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) â€” uses no extra space
